<p>The purpose of this exercise is to classify Spam/Phishing e-mails and talk about the reasons behind the classification.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume these are actual companies:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Pear:</strong>&nbsp;Is a company that sells yMobile smartphones. Official website : pear.co.uk</li>
	<li><strong>PayFriend:</strong>&nbsp;Is a company that helps with online payments. Official website: payfriend.com. Email address: payfriends@payfriend.com</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Spam</h3>

<div style="background-color: #ffc6bf;">
<div class="container-fluid" style="backgrond-color: #FFC6BF;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This message has been classified as spam/phishing e-mail because:</p>

<ul>
	<li><u>Suspicious sender</u> impersonating Apple</li>
	<li><u>All caps</u> in subject and use of caps throughout the e-mail should be considered as suspicious when the use is&nbsp;excessive</li>
	<li>The<u> link</u> that the e-mail uses is not an official apple website and it is most likely a phishing website where details are recorded and/or any transaction done is not associated with the purchase of any product.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>This might a simple example but spam/phishing e-mails/websites can be difficult to identify at a first glance:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Legitimate website and an illegitimate pop up window</li>
	<li>Illegitimate website can be identical to the legitimate one</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<h3>Phishing website</h3>

<div style="background-color: #ffc6bf;">
<div class="container-fluid" style="backgrond-color: #FFC6BF;">
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This website has been classified as a phishing website because:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Website address close to legitimate website but it&#39;s different</li>
	<li>Images are of lower quality</li>
	<li>Theme / Website&#39;s appearance is a bit off</li>
	<li>Log in might accept any information -&gt; no validation just recording details</li>
</ul>

<p>Possibly used to gather account information and gain access to accounts of that website.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Phishing websites can look identical to a legitimate site and the signs are not that obvious. Some hints for identifying phishing sites are to look for HTTPS (secure access) in the address (for banking services). However beware phishing websites can also use HTTPS.</p>
