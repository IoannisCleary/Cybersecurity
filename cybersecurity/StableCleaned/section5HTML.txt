<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">&ldquo;Better safe than sorry&rdquo; is a popular saying that is used in situations where it is important to stay safe and avoid any risks even if the situation might not seem very risky. This is often true when it comes to reading digital messages, even if it might not seem as something that might harm you, it can. Companies can rely on their reputation and productivity in order to be successful. Spam can have a negative effect on a worker&rsquo;s time and productivity; it can also cost a company or an individual a significant amount of money to repair the damages that it might inflict due to the possibility of malware infections or loss of information. Identity theft can damage an individual&rsquo;s credit score by adding a significant amount of debt or even accuse an individual of illegal activity since their name appears in the databases. These are some of the reasons of why it is important to respond appropriately in order to defend against spam.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">Spam often-present ideal situations to their potential victims whether it is a job opportunity or a great offer on certain products/services and the saying that comes to mind is &ldquo;if something is too good to be true, it probably is&rdquo;. One of the first things to look out for is these messages that present ideal situations that are unrealistic. The general rule is to not open spam messages, some of these messages might be detectable from the subject of the message but a lot of them either prefer to leave it blank or ambiguous in order to tempt a user into opening it. If the message that you have received is from an unknown or unfamiliar sender then do not open it.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">A message may look very legitimate as spammers can make messages look like they are from a trusted sender by adding the company&rsquo;s logo and creating a similar if not identical layout. However, services in general do not request account details to be confirmed or shared via e-mail. The best thing to do is to contact the service via telephone to confirm or report the message.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">As mentioned above spam can often keep the message as general as possible, not using a user&rsquo;s name or any specific detail about the user. If the message looks suspicious, avoid replying to it and avoid clicking on any link in the e-mail content. If you are unsure type the link into your browser (do not click to open the website) or hover over the link and try to look for any unusual patterns or do some research to find the official link to the service&rsquo;s website and see if they match. Spam often includes an &lsquo;Unsubscribe&rsquo; link in their message that does nothing but confirm that the e-mail address that they used to contact you is active. As an extra security measure, disable the preview pane and loading of images in your mailing software.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">Finally, it is highly recommended that antivirus software and filtering software are used and are regularly updated. Some email services such as GMAIL use antivirus software to scan attachments of incoming and outgoing messages for malware. If malware are detected then attachments are made unavailable for download to the receiver or notify the user/sender that the message cannot be sent until the infected attachment is removed. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
