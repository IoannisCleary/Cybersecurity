<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Phishing&nbsp;</strong>is a form of spam where the purpose of the message is to gather sensitive information from potential victims such as username, password or credit card details by deceiving users into handing over information.&nbsp;The people that send this type of message want to exploit this information in order to gain profit by charging the user or in general by stealing a user&#39;s identity. They usually look like a legitimate letters from a service, which usually redirects users to a website that imitates that service&rsquo;s website. It can start by urging users to take immediate action on reviewing some unusual activity on their account or by asking users confirm account details or other sensitive information.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Clone Phishing:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;This form of phishing attack creates a cloned version of a delivered e-mail that contained attachments. The attachments are replaced with malicious code and the message is resent to the original e-mail addresses, making it look like the original sender was the one sending it.</span></span></p>

	<li><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">Services that you have used</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">Information that you have shared on different social media platforms</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">This information is used in order to attempt to access your accounts and other sensitive information.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Whaling:</strong>&nbsp;This form of phishing attack is a variation of spear phishing that mainly focuses on people of a higher profile/status such as celebrities, politicians etc.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>DNS-Based</strong>: This form of phishing attack uses a router where a public WiFi access point is set up to attract users. The attackers DNS and phishing server is used to trick the victim (user) into entering personal/account details on fake web pages that imitate an official website&rsquo;s pages. (Also known as a form of man in the middle attack)</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Smishing</strong>: &nbsp;This form of phishing attacks takes place on a mobile device through SMS messages that usually request information or include malware infested website links.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">Phishing attacks can also make a user subscribe to premium rate text messaging services or take the form of bogus security software/applications such as an antivirus. Malware that can be spread through these attacks can also be used to gain access to certain information on devices or even spy on users.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">On Android devices phishing attacks can take the form of an application that imitates a legitimate application in the android market or the android market application itself. An application of this type may manipulate a user&#39;s browser or simply record sensitive information. Recently there was a report of a smishing (SMS phishing) attack on android devices where a message from a bank told users to install some kind of security application. However the link would download a malicious application (malware) that would either uninstall legitimate bank applications or would force the user to do it through a modified android market (google play) application. It would then replace the bank applications with altered applications of the uninstalled bank applications that would send data to a remote server. Similar attacks have been observed with popular applications where cloned applications that contained malware would show up in the android market. Applications like these can make a user subscribe to premium rate text messaging services. or take the form of bogus security software/applications such as an antivirus.</span></span></p>
