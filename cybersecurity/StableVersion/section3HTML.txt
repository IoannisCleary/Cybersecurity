<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">Android permission system involves what actions an application can perform. A list of permissions is shown before installation where it requests the user to grant them in order to install the application. If the user does not want to grant these permissions then they are unable to install the application. Permissions are split into groups such as SMS (where an application is granted permission to read, receive and send SMS messages), Location (where an application can keep track of approximate or precise location) and Contacts (where an application can read or modify contacts on a device).</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">Users can often agree to an application&rsquo;s permissions without considering the possibility that an application can abuse them. Recently there were reports of top-rated flashlight applications in the android market that were requesting a lot more of permissions than they required. Applications like these required permissions such Location, Identity, Microphone etc. The problem with this is that applications like could record information that has nothing to do with the application functionality and can quite possibly be used to spy on users (Spyware). Some people however could argue that installing an application like this is optional and the user has the power to grant the permissions. When updating applications they can request for new permissions before updating and if they are not granted, the user cannot acquire the latest update. This might be a problem with security as older versions might be more vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">In the paper &ldquo;<strong>Android SMS Malware: Vulnerability and Mitigation</strong>&rdquo; &shy; by Khodor Hamandi, Ali Chehab, Imad H. Elhajj and Ayman Kayssi&nbsp; there is a study that talks about malware that use a device&rsquo;s&nbsp; SMS services and how privileges that were granted by a user can be abused and still remain undetected by security software. It stresses the fact that privileges that have been granted before installation can become dangerous, as they remain unmodified. Android&rsquo;s broadcast service, which distributes data to services/applications that request them, does not guarantee that all applications will receive the original/unmodified data. Malicious software can be registered with top priority, which means that they would receive the data first and therefore can modify the data.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">This software, with the malicious code can suppress notifications of misuse and can continue to drain a user&rsquo;s &nbsp;credit without them noticing. In order to test the a scenario like this an application has been developed by the team in order to act as the malicious application where it will be suppressing notifications, sending messages and removing them from the local messages database so that a user will not have a history of these events. The application that was implemented in such a way that it would re-run services that have been terminated and it will continue with its malpractice.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif"><span style="font-size:14px">It has been tested between two devices one of which being an Android smartphone. When anti-malware applications were run, this application was not detected and it was even successfully published to the official android market. Finally the study suggested solutions to this problem such as: not allow applications to set their own priority (and possibly assigning a trusted application as the highest that will be in control), always inform a user when with the receipt of a SMS message and request permission each time a SMS message is sent.</span></span></p>
